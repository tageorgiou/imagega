* Make each polygon have a gradient with a color at each point, blending them
* Maybe make breeding dependent on position of polygons
* Change breeding to pick a random polygon from each set instead of picking a random set to pick nth polygon from
* Make background of image black to begin with
* Part of mutation - assign poly color from that point or average of poly on image? (maybe center of bounding rect)
* Make breeding not always use closest image
* Make comparison use delta-e or at least sqrt(colors**2)
* Make mutating work more
